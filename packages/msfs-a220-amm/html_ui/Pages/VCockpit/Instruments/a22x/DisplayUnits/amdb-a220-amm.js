// AMDB Airport Moving Map for the Synaptic A220, drawn from a local amdb-bridge.
//
// No Navigraph account, no hosts-file redirect and no certificate: the map fetches plain
// HTTP from the bridge on this machine, and the bridge builds whatever airport you are at
// on demand. Works the same under MSFS 2020 and 2024.
//
// The map mounts itself on the display that shows AIRPORT MAP FAULT, since the aircraft
// only ever prints that on the screen the airport map belongs to, and follows that
// display's own range selection. It draws below the aircraft's symbology, so the ND's
// own rings and readouts stay on top.
//
// Controls (bind these to keys, or leave them alone):
//   L:AMDB_AMM_VISIBLE   0 automatic (low or on the ground), 1 always on, 2 always off
//   L:AMDB_AMM_DISPLAY   which ND to use when the aircraft has more than one; 0 is auto
